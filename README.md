# Data-analyst-portfolio
I’m developing hands-on skills in Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to become a Data Analyst. This repository will showcase my end-to-end data projects, from cleaning and transforming raw data to generating insights and building dashboards.


The goal is to build a solid portfolio with real-world data analysis projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
