# Data-analyst-portfolio

This repository is my journey of becoming job-ready by January 2026. I’ll be uploading my learning projects in Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI, along with case studies and dashboards.
The goal is to build a solid portfolio with real-world data analysis projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

Projects Coming Soon:
🧮 Excel Case Study – Sales/HR Analytics  
🧠 SQL Query Practice & Case Problems  
🐍 Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
📊 Power BI Dashboard  
📁 Portfolio + Project Write-Ups
